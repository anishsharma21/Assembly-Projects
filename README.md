## Introduction

Ever tried learning something only to find out you needed a tonne of prerequisite knowledge? That's computer science for you! This repo aims to tackle that by tracing the chronological progression of programming. By following the historical development, you build on previous ideas, making it easier to grasp new concepts. ðŸš€

While assembly programming isn't the lowest level of abstraction (that would be digital logic), this repo starts after covering digital logic and microarchitecture. If you're keen on diving deeper, I highly recommend *CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software* by Charles Petzold. It's a fantastic, beginner-friendly book that takes you from lightbulbs and switches to a functioning processor. You can even create your own breadboard computer and custom assembly language! Check out my [Memory Map Emulator](https://github.com/anishsharma21/Memory-Map-Emulator) inspired by this book.

This repo doesn't assume prior knowledge of digital logic or microarchitecture, but having that foundation helps. Each directory here relates to a different programming language, with README files to help you set up your environment - at least if you're on macOS. I'm running Apple Silicon with macOS Sonoma. If you're on a different OS, steps might vary, and you'll need to do some investigating. If you find solutions or mistakes, feel free to open an issue!

With these guides, you can write and run programs, enjoy low-level programming, and gain a deep understanding of how the field has evolved. This knowledge will be invaluable throughout your career. Happy coding! ðŸ’»

## Project Logs

### x86 Assembly

Initially, the project focused on x86 assembly language for the GNU/Linux environment. To facilitate development and ensure a consistent environment, the x86 assembly programs were containerised using Docker. This allowed for easy setup and execution of the programs on any machine with Docker installed... or so I thought. The reality was that unless I was using an emulator like `qemu`, I couldn't write assembly programs targetting x86 architecture (with 32 bit registers) on an ARM64 machine, or at least not as seamlessly as with ARM64 assembly.

### ARM64 Assembly

The project then transitioned to exploring ARM64 assembly language with a RISC (reduced instruction set computing) ISA. Since I am developing on a ARM64 based Mac (M3 chip), I can use the xcode tools and specifically `clang` to both assemble and link my assembly programs, making the process of writing and executing assembly programs much easier. Resources for ARM64 assembly are pretty scarce or quite terse, so its a solid challenge overall - but, I found [this really good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg6kU42LQcY) that will get anyone with an M-chip mac up to scratch with ARM64 assembly programming on their mac's.

### MIPS Assembly

While the resources for ARM64 assembly language were better for my set up (MacOS + Apple silicon), there were still lofty barriers in the way of exploring more complex concepts like procedures, heap + stack allocation, or even writing systems software. As a result, I decided to look into MIPS - which stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. Like ARM, its also a RISC architecture, and was made also for education purposes, so there were plenty of resources to learn from. Additionally, I was working through the book *Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface*, which uses MIPS as its main assembly language to illustrate concepts and programs - so being able to write MIPS on my mac made following along with this book much more effective. In particular, I was using the `SPIM` simulator/cross-assembler (which I installed using `brew install spim`) to assemble my MIPS programs and run them with a set of `spim` commands.
Had the most fun and experience with MIPS - asked AI to give me 20 beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercises, and completed them in order - super useful tactic to learn the language, cover the basics, and build/apply your knowledge.
