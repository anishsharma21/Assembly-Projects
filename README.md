# EarlyLangs

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring early programming languages, starting with x86 assembly language and moving on to ARM64 assembly with the RISC ISA. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of low-level programming and the architecture of different processors.

## Project Overview

### x86 Assembly

Initially, the project focused on x86 assembly language for the GNU/Linux environment. To facilitate development and ensure a consistent environment, the x86 assembly programs were containerised using Docker. This allowed for easy setup and execution of the programs on any machine with Docker installed. 

But the difficulty in setting up a local environment with the right tools made it such that learning ARM64 assembly would be a better move.

### ARM64 Assembly

The project has now transitioned to exploring ARM64 assembly language with the RISC ISA. This involves writing and running assembly programs on ARM64 architecture, understanding the differences and similarities with x86 assembly, and leveraging the RISC design principles.
